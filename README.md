# Easy Python Projects for Beginners

This repository contains simple Python projects designed for beginners to practice basic programming concepts like:

- Variables, input/output, and data types  
- Conditional statements (`if/else`)  
- Loops and functions  
- Basic logic and problem solving  

Each project is self-contained and can be run individually. It’s a great way to reinforce foundational Python skills and build confidence before moving on to more advanced projects.
